# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Features

- Flexbox
- Grid
- Positioning
- BEM

## Brief

This is my first project alone of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

## Plans for improvement

With the project, it grew challenges that made it even more rewarding to overcome. Gaining a deeper understanding for grid and continue to understand flexbox. I plan to improve the route to the margin and padding to attempt a more simplicity.
